(A personal PHP project)

This website was started in 2005 -while doing an internship in Helsinki, Finland- as an exercise on how to program a website in a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP5) environment. Initially visitors could browse my comic and graphic novel collection, while I was able to manage the collection by adding, editing and deleting things from the database, using this website as a front-end.

Throughout the years this website has gone through multiple facelifts, more functionalities have been added (like an entire book collection) and a lot of time was invested in optimizing and simplifying the code that was already written.

I mainly use this website as an excuse to keep my programming skills sharp and to be on par with the ever evolving technologies used in web development.

In the future I would like to see this website interact with the Goodreads API, so more information about authors, their other books and similar items to the ones the visitor is viewing could be displayed

Website under construction, as it always will be.
